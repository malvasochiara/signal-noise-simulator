# signal-noise-simulator

This repository contains a Python-based implementation for generating sinusoidal signals. 

## Current Functionality
- **`signal_generator`**: Creates a signal composed of the sum of sinusoidal waves with customizable parameters, such as:
  - Maximum number of components (sine waves).
  - Signal duration (in seconds).
  - Sampling rate (in Hz).

The generated signals can be used for further analysis, testing, or as inputs to other processing functions.
## Testing

The following tests have been implemented to ensure the correct functionality of the **`signal_generator`** function:

-**`test_signal_length`**:
    Verifies that the length of the generated signal matches the expected length based on the duration and sampling rate.

-**`test_frequency_range`**:
    Ensures that all generated frequencies are within the valid range (positive and up to the Nyquist frequency).

-**`test_number_of_components`**:
   Confirms that the number of frequency components in the signal is between 1 and the specified maximum number of components.

-**`test_time_array`**:
    Checks that the time array generated by **`signal_generator`** contains the correct time points based on the duration and    sampling rate.

-**`test_signal_amplitude`**:
    Tests that the generated signal has non-zero amplitude.

These tests are designed to validate the typical use cases of the signal generation process, ensuring the correct functionality of the system.



## Work in Progress
This repository is under active development. New features and improvements will be added incrementally.
