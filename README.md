# signal-noise-simulator

This repository contains a Python-based implementation for generating sinusoidal signals. 

## Current Functionality
- **`signal_generator`**: Creates a signal composed of the sum of sinusoidal waves with customizable parameters, such as:
  - Maximum number of components (sine waves).
  - Signal duration (in seconds).
  - Sampling rate (in Hz).

The generated signals can be used for further analysis, testing, or as inputs to other processing functions.

## Work in Progress
This repository is under active development. New features and improvements will be added incrementally.
